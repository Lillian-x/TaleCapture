## How It Works
1. **Image Upload**: The user uploads three images via the simple web interface.
2. **Image Recognition**: The app uses OpenAI's CLIP model to analyze the uploaded images and extract key descriptions or themes.
3. **Story Generation**: Based on the image descriptions, the app uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate a creative and child-friendly bedtime story.
4. **Interactive Story**: The generated story is displayed on the web interface, providing a magical storytelling experience based on the uploaded images.

## Key Features
- **AI-powered Image Recognition**: Extracts key elements from images using OpenAI's CLIP model.
- **Custom Story Generation**: Uses GPT to generate a unique, personalized story for each set of uploaded images.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using Gradio for a simple, interactive interface.
- **Educational and Fun**: Provides an engaging tool for children, parents, and educators to create unique storytelling experiences.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Backend logic and AI model integration.
- **Gradio**: For the user-friendly frontend interface.
